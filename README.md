**How to Read Project**: Because our project is so huge, we decided to split it up into multiple parts. Below is the order in which to look at it.

    1. ScrapeScripts
        - This folder has the the script we used to scrape our data. We did it in Python, not a notebook since it was only coding.
    2. DataSets
        - These are the datasets we have. You don't have to look through these as we do give descriptions of the data in our actual notebooks. However, they are there if you want to see.
    3. final_project
        - These are where our notebooks are. They should be read in this order: 
            - DataCleaning.ipynb
            - Foundation_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb
            - RecommendationPredictor.ipynb

In the future, we plan to add a recommender system based on user attributes and user-based collaborative filtering to make a better version of Sephora's foundation matching quiz. Unfortunately, time did not permit to do this in the project we are turning in, but we are hoping in the future, it will work.

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy reading our project!
